# Fall 2023 Mini Jam
Submit your work for VGDC's First Fall Mini Jam! Read the instructions below for submissions:

First Set up your environment: 
1. I recommend using Github Desktop to clone this repositiory. You can click the code button then select
"Open with Github Desktop". You'll then be prompted to clone the repositiory by hitting the "Clone" button.
2. Create a new branch. In github desktop select the "Current Branch" button in the top middle of the screen. then
hit "Create new Branch. Name the branch your own name so we can easily parse through the entries.
3. Open the location of your branch by hitting the repository button at the top of Github Desktop and selecting "Show in Explorer".
This folder represents your working environment.
4. IMPORTANT: CREATE A NEW FOLDER WITHIN YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND NAME IT AFTER YOURSELF. When we go to merge things into main, if
files are not in a folder and have the same name, we'll have some conflicts. We can avoid these problems by putting your
assets in a unique folder.

Now that your environment is set up you can get to work! 

Once you've completed your asset, or want to update your current version open github desktop and follow these instructions:
1. All changes to the branch should be located on the left of github desktop. I would recommend filtering through these
changes and making sure all your desired files are there.
2. Write a commit Title and Description in the bottom left. Here you can title your work and make a description describing
what you did.
3. In order to commit the changes hit the commit button in the bottom left, then push your changes by hitting the
push to branch button in the top right.

Now you're changes should be with the repository!
